rancid:
Rancid means sour, rotten, and nasty and refers most specifically to the sharp bad
smell of decomposing oils or fats. "Rancid" is a great name for a post-punk
band, but a lousy way to describe the sauce on your eggs Benedict. 
----------------------------------
pestilent:
When something is pestilent, it's contagious and often deadly. At one time, polio was
considered to be a pestilent disease in North America.
