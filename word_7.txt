justification:
Close in meaning to an explanation, a justification is specifically for defending or explaining
an event. The idea that he was just trying to scare his little sister
was a pretty weak justification  for the elaborate gag.

To flout is to scorn or show contempt for. "I flout the law and
the concept of civilian safety by making a concerted effort to jaywalk every time
I cross a street."
